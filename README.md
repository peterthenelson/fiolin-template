# Welcome to Fiolin

This is your very own fiolin repository. You can update your existing scripts or
add new ones [here](./fiols).

## Setup

You need to have [node][nodedl] (at least v20) installed in order to use the
commands to run, test, and (re)deploy your scripts to github pages.

## Development

```sh
# Run a script locally from the command line:
# TODO

# Run the tests for your scripts:
# TODO

# Run a server and view your script in a web browser:
# TODO

# Publish the latest version of your scripts to github pages:
# TODO
```
